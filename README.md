# 👋 Hey there

I'm a backend engineer focused on building reliable, scalable systems with **Go**.  
I enjoy working with distributed systems, clean architectures, and performance-driven code.

### 🧠 My Toolkit
- **Main language:** Go
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **Tools & Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, NATS, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana

---
### 🧩 How I Work
- Architecting backend systems with a blend of precision and creativity  
- Writing **readable**, **testable**, **predictable** code — code that tells its own story  
- Embracing simplicity, patterns, and data-driven decisions — because chaos is only fun in games
