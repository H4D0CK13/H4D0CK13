# 👋 Hey there

I’m a backend engineer sailing the seas of **Go**, building reliable and scalable systems that hum like well-tuned engines.  
I dive into distributed systems, orchestrate clean architectures, and chase performance with a bit of obsession.  

---
### 🧠 My Toolkit
- **Main language:** Go
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB
- **Tools & Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, gRPC, NATS, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana

---
### 🧩 How I Work
- Architecting backend systems with a blend of precision and creativity  
- Writing **readable**, **testable**, **predictable** code — code that tells its own story  
- Embracing simplicity, patterns, and data-driven decisions — because chaos is only fun in games
